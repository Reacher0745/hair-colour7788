Balayage: The Art of Natural-Looking Highlights
Balayage is a popular hair coloring technique that creates natural-looking highlights. Unlike traditional foil highlights, balayage involves hand-painting the color onto the hair, resulting in a more seamless and sun-kissed effect. This technique is perfect for those who want a low-maintenance, yet sophisticated look.

Benefits of Balayage at Code Hair
Natural Appearance: The hand-painted technique allows for a more natural blend of colors, giving you a soft, effortless look.
Low Maintenance: Since balayage grows out more naturally, you won't have to worry about frequent touch-ups.
Customizable: Whether you prefer subtle highlights or a more dramatic contrast, our stylists can customize the balayage to suit your taste.
As the Best Balayage Salon in Dubai, we ensure that every balayage service is tailored to enhance your natural beauty.
